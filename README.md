### Bugs

- Problem: After changing the image path when converting images from jpeg to webp, images do not show.
- *Solution: incorrect file type was written. Update to .webp from .jpeg*

- Problem: Hero image text not appearing on top of hero image
- *Solution: Set the `position` of hero image text to `absolute`*

#### Unfixed Bugs

None

## Mistakes
------

Throughout the process of writing the code of this website. A few mistakes were made.
- A few of the first commits were over the 50 character max length.

(insert screenshot here)

*Solution: I adapted my commits to be shorter.*

- A few times I forgot to save before processing `git add` and `git commit`, so not all edits were included as intended.

*Solution: When this happened, I often noticed immediately, so I sent the same `git commit -m "    "` commit message twice in a row, so this would be covered.*

### **Mistakes Conclusion**

I learnt alot throughout the making of this website, especially regarding git commit's. This was a valuable lesson which I learnt and applied very quickly and also highlighted how easy it can be to make a simple mistake. This helped me to stay focused and aware of what I enter between commit's and saves.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **May 11th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
