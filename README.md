- Problem: Hero image text not appearing on top of hero image
    - *Solution: Set the `position` of hero image text to `absolute`*

#### **Unfixed Bugs**

- None

## Mistakes
------

Throughout the process of writing the code of this website. A few mistakes were made.
- A few of the first commits were over the 50 character max length.

(insert screenshot here)

*Solution: I adapted my commits to be shorter.*

- A few times I forgot to save before processing `git add` and `git commit`, so not all edits were included as intended.

*Solution: When this happened, I often noticed immediately, so I sent the same `git commit -m "    "` commit message twice in a row, so this would be covered.*

- When writing `git commit`'s for this README documentation, I accidently typed in the past tense.

*Solution: I noticed this within 2 commits and went back to the usual present tense*

### **Mistakes Conclusion**

I learnt alot throughout the making of this website, especially regarding git commit's. This was a valuable lesson which I learnt and applied very quickly and also highlighted how easy it can be to make a simple mistake. This helped me to stay focused and aware of what I enter between commit's and saves.
